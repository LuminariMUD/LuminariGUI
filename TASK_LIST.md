# TASK_LIST.md - List of Tasks and TODO Items for LuminariGUI

## MUST FIX THESE FIRST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Senior-Level Code Audit Results - Root Cause Analysis 

### CRITICAL SYSTEMIC ISSUES (Causing Cascading Failures)

#### **CRITICAL** - Fragile Event System Architecture
**Root Cause:** Uncontrolled event propagation with no dependency management
**Symptoms:** Fixing one component breaks others due to event cascade failures
**Evidence:** 
- 15+ `registerAnonymousEventHandler()` calls with no cleanup tracking
- MSDP events (`msdp.ROOM`, `msdp.AFFECTS`, `msdp.GROUP`) trigger multiple handlers simultaneously
- No event ordering or dependency resolution
- Event handlers can fail silently, breaking dependent systems

**Impact:** **HIGH** - This is the primary source of "fix one, break another" instability
**Fix Strategy:** Implement centralized event bus with dependency tracking and error isolation

#### **CRITICAL** - Shared Global State Corruption
**Root Cause:** Multiple systems write to shared globals without synchronization
**Symptoms:** State inconsistencies cause unpredictable behavior
**Evidence:**
- `GUI.toggles`, `msdp`, `map.room_info` accessed by multiple systems
- No state validation or rollback mechanisms
- MSDP data can be partially updated, leaving inconsistent state
- Race conditions between map updates and UI refreshes

**Impact:** **HIGH** - Changes to one system corrupt state for others
**Fix Strategy:** Implement immutable state patterns with validation

#### **CRITICAL** - Resource Lifecycle Management Failure
**Root Cause:** No coordinated cleanup of timers, handlers, and UI elements
**Symptoms:** Memory leaks and orphaned resources cause system degradation
**Evidence:**
- Timer cleanup with `killTimer()` only in some paths
- Event handlers registered but never cleaned up
- UI elements created but not properly destroyed
- `tempTimer()` calls without corresponding cleanup

**Impact:** **HIGH** - System becomes unstable over time
**Fix Strategy:** Implement RAII patterns with automatic cleanup

### HIGH PRIORITY ARCHITECTURAL FLAWS

#### **HIGH** - Missing Error Boundaries
**Root Cause:** Errors propagate unconstrained across system boundaries
**Symptoms:** Single component failure cascades to unrelated systems
**Evidence:**
- Limited use of `pcall()` for error containment
- No error recovery mechanisms
- Exception in one MSDP handler can break entire mapping system
- UI errors corrupt non-UI state

**Impact:** One small bug can bring down entire GUI
**Fix Strategy:** Implement error boundaries with graceful degradation

#### **HIGH** - Tight Coupling Between Components
**Root Cause:** Direct dependencies between unrelated systems
**Symptoms:** Cannot modify one system without affecting others
**Evidence:**
- Mapping system directly manipulates GUI elements
- Chat system depends on mapping state
- Button system tightly coupled to cast console
- No abstraction layers or interfaces

**Impact:** Maintenance nightmare - every change is risky
**Fix Strategy:** Implement loose coupling with message passing

#### **HIGH** - Initialization Race Conditions
**Root Cause:** Components initialize in unpredictable order
**Symptoms:** Intermittent startup failures and inconsistent behavior
**Evidence:**
- GUI elements created before dependencies are ready
- MSDP handlers registered before protocol negotiation
- No dependency declaration or initialization ordering
- `tempTimer()` delays used as band-aids

**Impact:** Unpredictable system behavior on startup
**Fix Strategy:** Implement dependency injection with ordered initialization

### MEDIUM PRIORITY STABILITY ISSUES

#### **MEDIUM** - Inadequate Input Validation
**Root Cause:** External data (MSDP, user input) processed without validation
**Symptoms:** Malformed data causes system corruption
**Evidence:**
- Direct access to `msdp.ROOM` without nil checks
- User input processed without sanitization
- No bounds checking on array access
- Assumes well-formed data structures

**Impact:** External data corruption can crash system
**Fix Strategy:** Implement comprehensive input validation

#### **MEDIUM** - Inconsistent Error Handling Patterns
**Root Cause:** No standardized error handling approach
**Symptoms:** Unpredictable error behavior across components
**Evidence:**
- Mix of `pcall()`, direct calls, and silent failures
- Some errors logged, others ignored
- No consistent error recovery strategy
- Different error handling in similar functions

**Impact:** Debugging is difficult, errors unpredictable
**Fix Strategy:** Standardize error handling patterns

#### **MEDIUM** - Performance Anti-Patterns
**Root Cause:** Inefficient algorithms in hot paths
**Symptoms:** System becomes sluggish, affecting responsiveness
**Evidence:**
- O(n) room positioning algorithm runs frequently
- Redundant font size calculations
- No caching of expensive operations
- String concatenation in loops

**Impact:** System responsiveness degrades over time
**Fix Strategy:** Optimize hot paths with caching and better algorithms

### LOW PRIORITY QUALITY ISSUES

#### **LOW** - Monolithic Function Design
**Root Cause:** Large functions with multiple responsibilities
**Symptoms:** Difficult to test, debug, and maintain
**Evidence:**
- Functions exceeding 50 lines with mixed concerns
- Single functions handling multiple unrelated tasks
- No separation of concerns
- Difficult to isolate issues

**Impact:** Maintenance difficulty, hard to locate bugs
**Fix Strategy:** Break into smaller, focused functions

#### **LOW** - Inconsistent Coding Standards
**Root Cause:** No enforced coding standards
**Symptoms:** Code is harder to read and maintain
**Evidence:**
- Mixed naming conventions (camelCase, snake_case)
- Inconsistent indentation
- No documentation standards
- Magic numbers throughout code

**Impact:** Reduced maintainability and readability
**Fix Strategy:** Establish and enforce coding standards

#### Phase 3: Long-term Stability (4-6 weeks)
1. **Implement Testing:** Add unit tests for critical functions
2. **Add Performance Monitoring:** Track resource usage and performance
3. **Create Documentation:** Document system architecture and dependencies
4. **Implement Graceful Degradation:** System should work even with component failures

### CONCLUSION

The root cause of your "fix one, break another" cycle is a lack of **system boundaries** and **dependency management**. The codebase has evolved into a tightly coupled system where changes ripple unpredictably through shared state and event handling.

**Priority Order:**
1. **Event System Redesign** - This is the biggest source of instability
2. **State Management** - Prevents corruption that causes cascading failures  
3. **Resource Management** - Stops memory leaks and orphaned resources
4. **Error Boundaries** - Contains failures to prevent system-wide crashes

This audit reveals that stability requires **architectural changes**, not just bug fixes. The current architecture makes every change risky because there are no isolation boundaries between components.
